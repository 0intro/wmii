    * libixp version 97 now required
    * Stack and max modes now affect floating clients:
        - max: Collapsed clients disappear, all clients disappear
               when managed layer is selected.
        - stack: All clients but selected are collapsed.
    * Adobe's Flash plugin's fullscreen mode now works.
    * Some annoying focus bugs are fixed.
