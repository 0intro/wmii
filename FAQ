Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1. I've just upgraded and something doesn't work.
-------------------------------------------------
If you compiled wmii yourself, please try again from a clean source
tree. If wmii still fails, try deleting or renaming your old
configuration files. If this fails, see questions #2.

2. I've read all of the docs, but I still need help.
----------------------------------------------------
You can get support[1] in the #suckless irc channel on irc.oftc.net, or
you can subscribe to the mailing list by sending an email to
dev+subscribe@suckless.org. You can also browse or search the
mailing list archives[2] at Gmane.

3. I think I've found a bug.
----------------------------
You can report bugs at the issue tracker at the Google Code
project[3]. Please be sure to search for your problem before you
open a new issue.

4. How do I get a list of keyboard shortcuts?
---------------------------------------------
The default keyboard shortcuts are listed in both the wmii(1)
manpage and in the user guide[4]. You can also get a list of all
current keyboard shortcuts at any time by selecting 'showkeys' from
the actions menu (M-a).

5. How do I customize wmii? How do I change my keyboard shortcuts?
------------------------------------------------------------------
You can customize wmii by editing its configuration script. If
you're using the stock wmiirc configuration script, you can add key
bindings and change your theme by editing @LOCALCONF@/wmiirc_local.
See @EXAMPLES@/wmiirc_local for more information. You should also be
sure to read wmii(1) and the user guide[4].

6. I've heard I can do my configuration in any language?
--------------------------------------------------------
While wmii is driven by a sh(1) script by default, it ships with
configuration scripts in several other languages, and more still are
available elsewhere on the web. See @ALTDOC@/README for more
information.

7. I've made some changes to my configuration. How do I reload it?
------------------------------------------------------------------
You can rerun your wmiirc script from the actions menu at any time.
If you're running the stock wmiirc, just select wmiirc. If you're
running the python wmiirc (and haven't moved it to
@LOCALCONF@/wmiirc), type python/wmiirc, and so on.

8. How do I restart wmii without killing X?
-------------------------------------------
You can either run 'exec wmii' from the actions menu or write 
'exec wmii' to the /ctl virtual file.

9. Why is there space around my terminal windows?
-------------------------------------------------
Your terminal has asked to only be resized in certain increments,
and there's not enough space for another row. `wmii` is forced to
compromise and leave blank space around it. If you'd rather wmii to
ignore the terminal's request, write 'incmode ignore'[5] to the /ctl
virtual file. Note, though, that this will prevent `wmii`'s normal
behavior of trying to keep these increment gaps as small as
possible, and will therefore result in more wasted space than
otherwise.

10. On FreeBSD, using p9p[6], I get an error about not being able to open /dev/fd/7.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to mount fdescfs on /dev/fd. See the BUGS section of rc(1)
for details.

11. How do I set a background image?
------------------------------------
This isn't the job of a window manager. You can set the background
with a third party tool, such as wmsetbg, Esetbg, feh, qiv,
xsetroot, etc.

12. How do I enable sequential shortcuts (like in ratpoison)?
 or How do I use wmii with emacs? The shortcuts collide!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Some applications make extensive use of the Alt key. The preferred
solution is to use the Windows, Apple, or Penguin key in its place.
It's assigned the identifier Mod4 on most systems. Set the
following in wmiirc_local:

    MODKEY=Mod4

Alternatively, you can use key chains, so you're required to press a
certain key combination before wmii accepts its shortcuts:

    MODKEY=Control-i,

13. How do I find out the names of keys to define keyboard shorcuts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest way is to run wikeyname(1) and type the key you want to
bind.
