- remove swapping action, merge vertocal swapping into moving - is this a good idea?
- remove internal labels, now tagging seems easy and straightforward that they
	THINK: We'll need CreateTag, DestroyTag, UnfocusTag, FocusTag and the
		event loop in wmiirc must be before TAGGING
can be externalized again
- idea for column mode:
	*: is the current default mode with fallback (shows arbitrary clients)
	0: is the current max mode, shows only one client at the time (same bahvior as current)
	n: shows n clients, in stacking mode, using the selected client as center,
		n == 1 is current stacking mode,
		n == equal will use the center of (n/2),
		n == unequal has always a center element.
- tagbars
- screen dimension rescaling if screen resolution changes (even with Xrandr)
- Xinerama support
- partly EWMH support
- libixp: idea from PoP: implement a va_args method similiar to printf for
		marshalling 9P messages, might reduce LOC drastically
- remove the geom syntax as it is now (with the +- stuff, and only
	allowing explicit coordinates, instead additionally resize
	+/-<w> +/-<h> and move +/-<x> +/-<y> actions are needed in the
	associated ctl devices of clients.  
- add wmiir ls (read should have same semantic as in 9p), output without
details, add -l for details like in ls of Plan 9
- liblitz: window abstraction (creation, events), can be reused in menu and bar
and frames

ad new column mode:

13:12 < Neptun> when present (like -T "Enter view name") it would create a
label with that text on the left part of the menu. what do you think?

- /def/ncol defines num of columns which should be created by default if possible.
