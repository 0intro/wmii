- idea for column mode:
	*: is the current default mode with fallback (shows arbitrary clients)
	0: is the current max mode, shows only one client at the time (same bahvior as current)
	n: shows n clients, in stacking mode, using the selected client as center, n == 1 is current stacking mode,
		n == equal will use the center of (n/2), n == unequal has always a center element.
- tagbars
- slot will be similiar to old wmi-10 slot, a separate window at the right side of the screen
- MWM/EWMH handling to support borderless apps?
