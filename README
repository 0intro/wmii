Abstract
--------
window manager improved-improved is a dynamic window manager for X11.
It supports classic and tiled window management with extended
keyboard, mouse, and 9P-based [1] remote control.
It consists of the wmiiwm(1) window manager and the wmiir(1)
the remote access utility.


Requirements
------------
In order to build wmii you need the Xlib header files and libixp. xmessage
and dmenu are used by the default scripts. libixp and dmenu can be obtained
from http://suckless.org/. Either plan9port[2] or 9base is recommended.


Installation
------------
First, edit config.mk to match your local setup, or to let us guess it, run:
	make config

To build, simply run:
	make

To install, run the following, as root, if necessary:
	make install

Running wmii
------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start wmii using startx:

    until wmii; do
	true
    done

In order to connect wmii to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly. For example:

    DISPLAY=:1 wmii

This will start wmii on display :1.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of wmii is done by customizing the rc script rc.wmii.local,
which remotely controls the window manager and handles various events.
The main rc.wmii script lives in PREFIX/etc/wmii-3.5/, while rc.wmii.local
goes in $HOME/.wmii-3.5/.

rc.wmii.local should contain a line containing just: '# Overrides'. You must
set your MODKEY and other configuration variables before this line, if you
wish to change then, and define most functions after it.
