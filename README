Abstract
--------
window manager improved 2 is a dynamic window manager for X11.
It supports classic and tiled window management with extended
keyboard, mouse, and 9P-based [2] remote control.
It consists of the wmiiwm(1) window manager, the wmiir(1)
remote access utility, and a tiny wmiimenu(1).


Requirements
------------
In order to build wmii you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. wmii is installed into
the /usr/local hierarchy by default. If your system is Mac OS X,
then remove the '-static' flag in cmd/Makefile. If your system is
Solaris, grep recursively for 'Solaris' and uncomment all occurences
to make wmii compile or ask Sun to make their system POSIX compliant.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install wmii (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running wmii
------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start wmii using startx:

    exec wmii

In order to connect wmii or wmiir to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec wmii

This will start wmii on display :1 of the host foo.bar.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of wmii is done by customizing the sh script wmiirc,
which remotely controls the window manager and handles various events.
Copy the file from PREFIX/etc/wmii-3/ (usually /usr/local/etc/wmii-3/)
to $HOME/.wmii-3/ and edit it to fit your needs.
