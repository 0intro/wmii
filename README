Abstract
--------
wmii is a dynamic window manager for X11.  It supports classic and
tiled window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and 9P-based[1]
remote control.  It consists of the wmii(1) window manager and the
wmiir(1) the remote access utility.


Requirements
------------
In order to build wmii you need the Xlib header files and libixp.
xmessage is used by the default scripts.  Libixp, if not provided, can
be obtained from http://libs.suckless.org/.  On debian, you should be
able to obtain all dependencies by running `make deb-dep`.  Python is
recommended for more advanced configurations.


Installation
------------
First, edit config.mk to match your local setup.

To build, simply run:
	make

To install, run the following, as root if necessary:
	make install

On debian, you should only have to run `make deb` to create a debian
package.  No further configuration should be necessary.


Running wmii
------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start wmii using startx:

    until wmii; do :; done

In order to connect wmii to a specific display, make sure that the
DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly.  For example:

    DISPLAY=:1 wmii

This will start wmii on display :1.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of wmii is done by customizing the rc script wmiirc,
which remotely controls the window manager and handles various events.
The main wmiirc script lives in @CONFPREFIX@/wmii@CONFVERSION@/, while
wmiirc_local goes in $HOME/.wmii@CONFVERSION@/.

More advanced versions of wmiirc are provided in python and ruby.
For more information on them, see alternative_wmiircs/README.
