\section{Abstract}

  \subsection{The purpose of this document}

    This document tries to be a good starting point for people new to
    wmii--3.  People who have used wmi, wmii--2.5 or even ion will get
    to know what is new and different in wmii--3, and people who have
    never used a tiling window manager before will fall in love with
    the new concept.
  
  \subsection{Wmii --- the second generation of window manager improved}

    Wmii--3 is a new kind of window manager. It is designed to have a
    small memory footprint, be extremely modularised and have as
    little code as possible, thus ensuring as few bugs as possible. In
    fact, one of our official goal is to not to exceed $10 k$ lines of
    code~\footnote{ benefits of the $10 k$ SLOC restriction are that
    it's easier to read/understand, thus it's easier to use and get
    used to.}.

    Wmii tries to be very portable and to give the user as much
    freedom as possible.

    Wmii--3 is the third major release of the second generation of the
    window manager improved~\footnote{ the ii is actually the roman
    numeral for 2.}.  Wmii first introduced a new paradigm in version
    2.5, namely the dynamic window management, that overcomes the
    limitations imposed by the WIMP paradigm (see also the companion
    \emph{wmii.tex}).
  
  \subsection{Target audience}

    I presume the reader already has experience with Unix, knows all
    the basic terminology and concepts like files and editors.

    I hope you are open minded to new ideas, and willing to spend some
    time learning \wmii--3~\footnote{remember the refrain: ``nobody
    can teach you what you don't want to know''.}.

    If you only want to know how to operate wmii-3 and are not
    interested in the inner workings or in scripting, you may read
    sections \ref{sec:conf&install}, \ref{sec:terms} and subsection
    \ref{subsec:firststeps} and skip the rest.

    However, to get the most out of wmii--3 you should probably read
    the whole document ``sequentially'', i.e. from beginning to end.
    Another possibility is to read/consume the guide ``on demand'' as
    you notice you need more information or details to understand
    better some concept. We recomend you to read the introductory
    chapters first, use some time to get settled in the wmii--world
    and read the scripting chapters later on.
    
    \section{Configuration and install}
    \label{sec:conf&install}

    \subsection{Obtaining wmii}

    Wmii is licensed under the MIT/X Consortium License, which
    basically means it is free software, and you are free to download
    from \hrefx{http://wmii.de} free of charge~\footnote{ please have
      a look at \hrefx{http://wmii.de/repos/wmii/LICENSE}  for
      details}.
    
    \subsection{Configuration and Installation}
    
    First of all, have a look if there are binary packages of wmii in
    your distribution. Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo should already have
    good packages. If you found a package to trust, you may now safely
    skip this section.

    For all those who are still reading this, let me tell you that you are
    on the good side because if you grab the sources and compile them yourself
    you'll benefit from having everything in it's original place, so
    it'll ease your use of wmii.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      
    \item Uninstalling a previous version:
      \begin{verbatim}
        cd /path/to/wmii-previous
        make uninstall && make clean 
      \end{verbatim}

      In case you're installing a newer version of \wmii, this is the
      first thing you should do otherwise you'll end up mixing
      binaries, configuration files and manual--pages of different and
      potentially incompatible versions.

    \item Unpack it:
      \begin{verbatim}
        tar xzf wmii-3.tar.gz
        cd wmii-3
      \end{verbatim}
      
    \item Edit the configuration:
      \begin{verbatim}
        vim config.mk
      \end{verbatim}
      
      The most important variable to set is the \verb+PREFIX+, which
      states, where you want \wmii --3 to be installed to. If you are unsure, keep the
      default, it won't break your system.
      
    \item Run make and make install:
      \begin{verbatim}
        make && make install
      \end{verbatim}
      
    \item Setup the X--server to start \wmii as your default window
      manager. You may do that by editing the file \emph{\~{}/.xinitrc}.

      \begin{verbatim}
        #!/bin/sh
        exec wmii
      \end{verbatim}

      % Not necessary, .xinitrc is sourced by xinit anyways
      %
      %    Make sure that the \emph{\~{}/.xinitrc} is executable:
      %
      %    \begin{verbatim}
      %      chmod u+x ~/.xinitrc
      %    \end{verbatim}

    \end{enumerate}
    
    Now you are finished. Please note that autoconf tools are not used
    for various reasons~\footnote{ read
      \hrefx{http://www.ohse.de/uwe/articles/aal.html} and
      \hrefx{http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/2003-November/029714.html}
      for further details} . Please don't ask the \wmii developers to use autoconf,
    they won't listen you.


    \section{Terminology}
    \label{sec:terms}  

    Before you actually start doing your first steps in \wmii, first the
    terminology has to be clarified.

    \subsection{Clients}

    A client is a program, that provides you a graphical user interface for
    a special purpose, e.g. a web browser, or a terminal.
    
    \subsection{Focus}

    The (input) focus is the client, which currently receives your input.
    In X11 exactly one client can get your input at a time. If you input
    some command into your terminal, the terminal window has the input focus,
    whereas all the other windows do not receive the input you enter.
    
    \subsection{Events}

    An event is a message generated by X server to notify X clients about
    states. For instance,  X generates a button press event, if you click
    into a window.
    
    \subsection{Tags}

    A tag is an alphanumeric string you can associate to clients,
    which allows you to group clients in a natural way.
    
    In \wmii, there are no workspaces anymore. Instead, all clients matching a
    particular tag are displayed at a time.  For instance, if you tag your
    browser and a terminal window with the tag ``web-browser'', and you request
    to view all clients matching this tag, \wmii will display your browser
    and the terminal on the screen.
    It is also possible to give clients multiple tags, which is described later.

    \subsection{View}

    A view is the set of displayed clients, which match a specific single tag.
    A view is pretty similiar to the ``workspace'' metaphor in other window
    managers, though more powerful.

    Only one view can be visible at a time.

    Views are related to the tags, which are currently in use. You have exactly
    one view for each single tag, thus you can only view sets of clients which
    match an existing tag.

    If you destroy the last client with a tag, the view of this tag is
    destroyed.

    \subsection{Column}

    A column is a distinct part of a view, where clients are arranged
    automatically in a vertical direction.

    In \wmii, you are able to divide each view into different columns.
    You should be aware, that every column holds at least one client.
    As soon as you close the last client of a column, the column is
    destroyed automatically.

    % no, a view might contain floating clients only as well
    %    Please be aware, that every view has at least one column or a floating window.

    \subsection{Layout}

    A layout is the arrangement of clients in a column.
    There are three different ways to arrange clients in a column.
    \paragraph{default} This layout arranges each client with
    equally vertical space fitting into the columns height.
    \paragraph{maximum} This layout arranges all clients with
    the same geometry as the column, showing only one of them at a time.
    \paragraph{stacking} This layout arranges all clients
    like a stack, where only the focused client is completely
    visible, and all other clients can be accessed through its title--bars.
    This is an alternative approach to \emph{tabbing}.

    \section{Getting started}

    Now it is time to start diving into the \wmii user experience. I suggest you
    to try everything described by yourself immediately, instead of first reading
    it, to avoid "memory leakage".  It is very helpful, if you print this
    document on paper or have it available on a different screen, because you might not
    be able to view it during your first steps in \wmii.

    Note, that the \emph{MOD} key I am referring to, may resemble
    different keys on different systems. By default it the 
    \emph{Mod1} or \emph{Alt} key in X11. Normally this is the key labelled with
    \emph{Alt} on your keyboard.

    The notation \emph{MOD}--\emph{Key} means to press \emph{MOD} and 
    \emph{Key} both at the same time.

    All key combinations can be freely configured, but for the sake of
    simplicity I'll stick with the default key combinations for this
    guide.  You will learn how to alter the bindings in the
    section \ref{sec:scripting}.

    The default key combinations heavily use the home row navigation keys
    \emph{h} (left), \emph{j} (down), \emph{k} (up), and \emph{l} (right),
    which are associated with the specific direction.

    \subsection{First steps}
    \label{subsec:firststeps}

    Start your X session now. Since it is the first time you
    start \wmii, a window with a little tutorial will show up. You are
    free to read it, but you may also follow this guide :-)

    First of all, press \emph{MOD--Enter} to start an xterm. It will
    take half of the vertical space, so you have two equally arranged
    windows. If you press \emph{MOD--Enter} again, you have three
    windows that are arranged equally.

    To switch between the three windows, press
    \emph{MOD--j}, which cycles the focus between the three windows.

    You can also press \emph{MOD--k} to switch to the window above or
    \emph{MOD--j} to switch to the window below the current.

    Now look at the title--bars of those windows. They display 
    important information: the first label contains the tag of
    the window. The second label displays the window's title.

    Similiar information is displayed in the status--bar at the bottom.  The
    first labels display the tags currently in use and highlight the currently
    selected view. On the right side some status information is displayed, by
    default the system load and the current time (see
    subsection~\ref{subsec:status} for details).

    \subsection{Using columns}

    As described earlier, \wmii uses columns to arrange your windows.
    Your view already consists of a single column.
    Next, you will create a new column.

    In \wmii columns always consists of at least a single client,
    thus to create a new column, you need at least two clients at hand.

    Now focus a client of your choice and press \emph{MOD--Shift--l},
    which moves the client rightwards. As you see, \wmii creates
    a new column by dividing the view horizontally in two equally big
    areas. The focused client has been moved into the new column.

    If you close the last client of a column, the column is destroyed
    immediately. If the last client of the current view is closed,
    the view will be removed accordingly as well.

    If you press \emph{MOD--j} to change focus, you will see that \wmii
    actually cycles the focus in the current column only.

    To change the focus to a different column, you can press \emph{MOD--l}
    (right) and \emph{MOD--h} (left) respectively.

    It is also possible to swap adjacent clients among columns. To swap
    clients leftwards, press \emph{MOD--Control--h}. To swap clients
    rightwards, press \emph{MOD--Control--l}.

    \subsection{What about layouts?}

    Layouts arrange clients in a column. They are related to a single
    column.  Thus it is possible to have different columns in one view, each
    using another layout.

    The default layout arranges each client of the column with equally
    vertical space. You can enable this layout with \emph{MOD--d}
    (where the ``d'' stands for default) explicitly.

    The stacking layout can be enabled with \emph{MOD--s}.  As you see now,
    there is only one client using as much space as possible, and only
    title--bars of the other clients displayed in the column. You can 
    switch between the clients in the column using \emph{MOD--j}.

    The max-layout maximizes all clients to the same geometry as the column.
    Only the focused client is displayed at a time, all other clients
    are behind it. You can switch between the clients with \emph{MOD--j}.

    \subsection{Floating layer}

    To handle clients in the classical way, like in conventional window
    managers, the so-called ``floating layer'' is used. Actually there are a
    bunch of clients which don't fit well into the tiled world, because they
    have been designed with the conventional window management in mind,
    for instance clients like the Gimp or xmms.

    While \wmii is a dynamic window manager, which does the window arrangement
    for you automatically, those old fashioned programs rely on the
    conventional window managing concept, where all the clients fly around on
    your desktop and you are forced to constantly order the mess.

    To attach such broken clients to the floating layer, you can toggle the
    focus between floating and managed layer through pressing \emph{MOD--Space}.
    The \emph{MOD--Shift--Space} shortcut toggles the focused window between
    floating and managed layer.

    Note, the floating layer is addressed as the zeroth-column internally.

    \subsection{Tags}

    Up to now all your clients were tagged with ``1'', and you only had
    this single view. But a single view does not scale well, once
    too many clients appear which are used for different unrelated tasks.
    Thus you might want to have a view per task, e.g. a view
    with your editor and your programming tools, another view 
    with your browser, and a third view with your music jukebox.

    The good news is, that the tagging concept provides a very dynamic way to
    achieve such kinds of grouping.

    You can give the focused client another tag by pressing
    \emph{MOD--Shift--Number}, number being one of the numbers 0 to 9.

    You can then switch views through pressing \emph{MOD--Number}.

    Normally, whenever a new client appears, it automatically inherits the tag
    of the currently selected view.

    %% TODO: better tag handling (this is about to change in \wmii till 
    %%version 3)

    Note, there are more powerful uses of tags you will learn about in the next
    chapter. You will then be able to assign multiple tags to one client and to
    use proper strings as tags.

    \subsection{How do I close a window?}

    Most X-clients have a menu option or button to be closed. For the rare
    cases they don't provide a mouse-driven way, like in most terminals,
    you can press \emph{MOD--Shift--c} to close a window.

    \subsection{How do I start programs?}

    You may start programs from a terminal. But \wmii contains a special
    keyboard-driven program menu, which is accessible through pressing
    \emph{MOD--p}. Please note, that the content of this menu is provided by a
    simple shell--script.

    You will see a list of programs. If you start typing, the
    menu will cut the list and only display items which match
    the input you entered so far (in that order). Whenever there is
    only one item left, the menu highlights it and you can start it
    by pressing \emph{Enter}. You are free to cancel any action by
    pressing \emph{ESC}.

    Thus, if you want to start firefox, just type ``fire'' and press
    enter~\footnote{On my system it is sufficient to type ``efo'' to
      start firefox;-)}.

    \subsection{How do I quit wmii?}
    You can quit \wmii, by using the action's menu (\emph{MOD--a})
    and selecting the action ``quit'. That's all.
    
    \section{Looking under the hood}

    In this chapter you will learn how \wmii was designed, which ideas
    the \wmii developers followed and how it was implemented.

    \subsection{Dynamic window management}

    \wmii was designed around the new idea of dynamic window management.
    Dynamic window management means, that the window manager should make all
    decisions about window arrangement, thus taking most extra work away
    from the user and letting him concentrate on his work. This can also be
    seen as tacit window management.

    \subsection{Modularity -- using distinct tools for distinct tasks}

    The developers of \wmii know about the most powerful ideas of
    Unix. One of them is the idea to use distinct tools for distinct
    tasks. By carefully designing the window manager, they were able to
    split the task into several smaller binaries, each with a distinct
    job.
    
    \subsection{The glue that puts it all together -- 9P}

    Programs in the Unix world usually communicate via buffers which are
    addressed by (file) descriptors, one of them are sockets.

    To create a lightweight but powerful communication protocol, the \wmii
    developers closely looked at the design of Plan9 and chose the 9P
    protocol.

    The basic ideas for configuring and running \wmii were taken from
    the Acme user interface for programmers of Plan 9. Similiar to Acme,
    \wmii provides a filesystem-interface, which can be accessed by
    9P clients. This allows to interact with any different kind of
    application through a file system interface, which might be implemented
    in any programming language of choice. This also avoids to force
    client programmers to a specific programming language or paradigm.
    
    The interface of \wmii can be compared to the \emph{procfs} file
    system of the Linux kernel.

    If you want to interact with a running \wmii process, you can access its 9P
    file-system service through either using the bundled tool \emph{wmiir} or
    the 9P2000 kernel module of a Linux kernel later than 2.4.16+.  Using the
    kernel module has the advantage to mount the filesystem of \wmii into your
    file system hierarchy directly, though it has the drawback that this need
    \emph{root} privileges.

    \subsection{Tools}

    This section provides a basic overview about the tools which are bundled
    with \wmii. But for a more detailed description, you should read the associated
    man page of the specific tool.
    
    \begin{description}
      
    \item
      \emph{wmiir} is a small tool we is used to access the
      virtual file--system service of \wmii remotely. It basically supports four
      operations:

      \begin{itemize*}
      \item read
      \item write
      \item remove
      \item create
      \end{itemize*}

      wmiir needs to know the address of the file-system service to work
      with. On startup, \wmii exports the \verb+WMII_ADDRESS+ environment variable,
      which points to the address of the file-system service of wmii.
      This address can be:
      \begin{itemize*}
      \item a local unix socket address like \verb+unix!/path/to/socket+ 
      \item a tcp-capable socket address like \verb+tcp!hostname:port+ 
      \end{itemize*}
      
      If you want to work on a different file--system, you may specify it
      manually with the \emph{-a  address} command line option.
      A sample invocation looks like:
      \begin{verbatim}
        wmiir read /
      \end{verbatim}
      This command actually prints the contents of the root directory of the
      virtual file-system of \wmii.

    \item
      \emph{wmiimenu} is a generic keyboard--driven menu, which matches items
      through providing patterns.  You may want to learn more about it by reading
      the man-page.

    \item
      \emph{wmiiwarp} is a tiny tool to warp the mouse pointer at specific
      coordinates on your screen.

    \item
      \emph{wmiiwm} is the main window manager binary. You may interact
      with its virtual file-system only.

    \item
      \emph{wmiipsel} prints the contents of the current X selection to
      STDOUT. This is useful for scripts.

    \end{description}

    \subsection{Conclusion}

    The virtual file-system service of \wmii and the tools presented enable
    you to fully control the window manager from scripts.
    You will see some examples in the next section
    \ref{sec:scripting}.

    \section{Scripting wmii}
    \label{sec:scripting}

    In this chapter you will see how to control \wmii through scripts. I will
    give you some pointers, that you can start scripting on your own.

    \subsection{Language}

    As mentioned earlier, the only requirement for interacting with \wmii is to
    access its file-system service. The easiest way to do this, is by using
    the wmiir tool. Thus shell scripts are the easiest way of adapting \wmii
    too fit your needs.

    Hence, you can control \wmii in any programming language you want. However,
    \wmii's default scripts are written in a subset of ``sh'' that is POSIX
    compliant, to keep \wmii as \emph{portable} as possible.
    
    To keep simplicity, the following examples will stick to ``sh'' as well,
    and don't depend on python, tcl, ruby, \dots 

    % - who doesn't have a shell?, extra! we're giving them for free this week

    \subsection{Actions}

    In \wmii you may group certain tasks into \emph{actions}. Actions
    are nothing more than simple scripts which are located either in
    your local or in the default \wmii configuration
    directory~\footnote{ \texttt{\$CONFPREFIX} is set in
      \emph{config.mk} which points to \texttt{/usr/local/etc}
      or \texttt{\$HOME/.wmii-3} by default}.
    Through pressing \emph{MOD-a} you can open the actions-menu. It works
    similar to the program menu, but only displays actions.

    You might want to add your own actions through writing shell scripts in the
    default \wmii configuration directory or in the \texttt{\$HOME/.wmii-3}.
    
    This works, because in the \wmii controlling script exports the variable
    \verb+$PATH+ as\\ \verb+$PATH=~/.wmii-3:$CONFPREFIX/wmii:$PATH+ before
    launching the wmiiwm, this way local user actions under
    \verb+~/.wmii-3+ take precedence over the defaults from
    \verb+$CONFPREFIX/wmii+ of the default actions.
    
    You may edit this file on the fly, which means you don't need to
    stop \wmii before editing. After you've finished editing, you may
    simply run wmiirc and the changes will take effect immediately.
    To do so, just open the actions menu (with pressing \emph{MOD-a}) and
    choose the \emph{wmiirc} action. It's also possible to launch \wmii actions
    directly from a terminal, which is a neat side effect that results from
    exporting \verb+$PATH+ in the \wmii startup script.

    \subsection{wmiirc}
    
    \emph{wmiirc} is a special ``sh''-script which is launched on startup
    of \wmii to take care of configuring and controlling \wmii.

    It does so through writing data to several files of the virtual \wmii
    file-system, and through reading events reported by \wmii during runtime.
    Events are mostly shortcut presses, mouse clicks or user-defined.
    The events are processed in a loop in the script.
    
    Thus, for the basic configuration of \wmii, like changing the default
    modifier key \emph{MOD=Mod1} or the navigation keys this script is
    the place to look at.

    The name \emph{wmiirc} means \wmii \emph{run command}, because ``rc'' is an
    old Unix abbreviation for ``run command''.

    \subsection{Changing the style}

    The style of \wmii --3 is defined through font and color values, which are
    unobstrusively exported with the following \emph{environment variables}.

    \begin{verbatim}
      WMII_SELCOLORS='#000000 #eaffff #8888cc'
      WMII_NORMCOLORS='#000000 #ffffea #bdb76b'
      WMII_FONT=static
    \end{verbatim}

    \verb+WMII_SELCOLORS+ defines the colors of the selected client's window
    title and border, whereas \verb+WMII_NORMCOLORS+ defines the colors of all
    unselected clients. The numbers are hexadecimal rgb tuple-values, which you
    might know from HTML. You can grab them with the Gimps color-chooser for instance.

    The first color defines the text color of strings in bars and menus.
    The second color defines the background color of bars and clients, and
    the third color defines the 1px borders surrounding bars and clients.

    \verb+WMII_FONT+ defines the font which should be used for drawing text.
    in title--bars, the status--bar, and the wmiimenu.
    You can query for different fonts using \emph{xfontsel} for instance.

    \subsection{Filling the status--bar}
    \label{subsec:status}
    
    The status bar of \wmii has it's own \verb+/bar+ directory with
    a subdirectory for each of the labels created. So while editing
    this document my status-bar looked like:

    \begin{verbatim}
      $ wmiir read /bar
      d-r-x------ salva salva     0 Mon Apr 17 14:19:51 2006 1
      d-r-x------ salva salva     0 Mon Apr 17 14:19:51 2006 2
      d-r-x------ salva salva     0 Mon Apr 17 14:19:51 2006 status
    \end{verbatim}
    
    At the same time each of the subdirectories contains two files,

    \begin{verbatim}
      $ wmiir read /bar/status
      --rw------- salva salva    23 Mon Apr 17 14:22:14 2006 colors
      --rw------- salva salva    23 Mon Apr 17 14:22:14 2006 data
    \end{verbatim}


    The first file contains the color definitions that control how the
    bar will be drawn, while the second contains the data
    which is displayed.
    
    Now you can start your own experiments by creating a new label, and
    exploring and modifying it by reading \& writing values to it's
    \verb+colors+ \& \verb+data+ files.  A nice feature of the bar
    (and clients) is that they generate events corresponding to mouse
    clicks on them.  You can open a terminal and run
    \verb+wmiir read /event+ to see how the events are generated
    when you click onto the status--bar. This is a mechanism that allows
    controlling applications directly from the bar. If you've
    finished and you want to get rid of your label,
    a \verb+wmiir remove /bar/foo+ command.
    
    If you want to learn more, take a look at the status script and 
    visit \hrefx{http://wmii.de} for good examples, like the following:

    \begin{itemize*}
    \item \emph{status}: monitoring remaining battery, temperature, \dots on laptops
    \item \emph{status-mpd}: controlling the running mpd
    \item \emph{status-load}: show the machine load
    \item \emph{status-net}: monitoring wireless network signal
    \end{itemize*}
    
    Now open the default status script and try to understand yourself,
    how it works \verbatiminput{../rc/status}. The first line is a handy
    \verb+xwrite+ function declaration, to prevent you from several verbosity
    when issuing a write to some file. The following 3 lines take care of
    creating and setting up the \verb+status+ label. The last section is a
    \verb+while+ loop
    that \emph{tries} to write the system load and date information
    to the bar.\\
    
    The tricky bit is, that it \emph{tries}. So what could make the write
    fail? If \verb+xwrite+ tried to write to a non existent (removed)
    label, then it would fail, thus the condition of the loop would be
    false, and the status script exits cleanly, which makes sense
    because nobody wants a program that updates a nonexistent label.\\

    Now go back to the first lines of the script, and note 
    that there is a \verb+sleep delay+ between the removal of the
    label and it's creation.
    
    This ensures that the \verb+status+ label will not exist, hence all
    the writes made from any previously running \verb+status+ script
    will fail, thus they will finish. This way we make sure that
    we only run one status script at each time.  And thus we keep the
    one-to-one correspondence between label and status script.
    
    \subsection{Assigning new tags}
    
    As mentioned before, you can achieve more poweful things with tags, than
    with the standard key-bindings. You might use any string as a tag. You may
    even use more than one tag per client. To do so, you have to separate the
    tags with a ``+''.

    \begin{verbatim}
      echo -n web+code | wmiir write /view/sel/sel/tags
    \end{verbatim}

    This command would give the current focused client the tags
    ``web'' and ``code''.
    
    You can now view the ``web'' tag by executing the following:

    \begin{verbatim}
      echo -n view web | wmiir write /ctl
    \end{verbatim}

    As the development of \wmii --3 progressed, it became clear that this
    action is so common, that it got its own keybinding. By default
    \emph{MOD-t} brings up a menu to choose a view and
    \emph{MOD-Shift-t} brings up a menu enabling you to assign new
    tags to the focused client.

    % TODO:
    % I would also like to put/see a recommended readings or bibliography
    % section this will be of course biased by my use of plumber and acme
    % from p9p but i think it's worth mentioning both them here. similar to:

    \section{The End}
    \label{sec:end}
    
    We hope this helps you getting used to \wmii.

    with smoke signals~\footnote{ but don't ask us for advice, here
      you're on your own \texttt{;-P}.}.

    Also remember that \wmii is written by people with taste, so most
    of the decisions made have strong reasons supporting them, so if
    you think something doesn't make sense or doesn't fit into the
    picture, just try to understand it by yourself first before
    asking, probably you'll end up learning a lot and if its really
    wrong in the end, you'll provide us with much better feedback to
    solve the issue.
