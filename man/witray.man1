= NAME =

witray - The wmii system tray

= SYNOPSIS =

witray [-a <address>] [-NESW] [-HV] [-p <padding>] [-s <iconsize>] [-t tags] +
witray -v

= DESCRIPTION =

`witray` is a simple system tray program meant to be used with wmii.
It supports the Freedesktop System Tray Protocol Specification
common among all newer applications and desktop environments. The
tray is only visible when applications require it.  While there are
many standalone system tray applications, this one is explicitly
tailored to wmii. It's simple, stays out of the user's way, is easy
to configure, and generally Just Works.
