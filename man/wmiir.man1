= NAME =

wmiir - The wmii 9P filesystem client

= SYNOPSIS =

wmiir [-a <address>] {create | ls [-dlp] | read | remove | write} <file> +
wmiir [-a <address>] xwrite <file> <data> ... +
wmiir -v

= DESCRIPTION =

`wmiir` is a simple 9P filesystem client which ships with `wmii`, and connects
to its virtual filesystem by default. `wmiir` is most often used to query and
issue commands to `wmii`, both from the command line and from its `sh`-based
configuration scripts.

= ARGUMENTS =

: -a
        The address at which to connect to `wmii`.
:
= COMMANDS =

The following commands deal with 9P filesystems.

: create <file>
        Creates a new file or directory in the filesystem. Permissions and
        file type are inferred by `wmii`. The contents of the standard input
        are written to the new file.
: ls [-dlp] <path>
        Lists the contents of <path>.

        Flags:
        >>
        : -d
                Don't list the contents of directories.
        : -l
                Long output. For each file, list its permissions, owner,
                group, size (bytes), mtime, and name.
        : -p
                Print the full path to each file.
        <<
: read <file>
        Reads the entire contents of a file from the filesystem. Blocks until
        interrupted or EOF is received.

        Synonyms: `cat`
: remove <path>
        Removes <path> from the filesystem.

        Synonyms: `rm`
: write <file>
        Writes the contents of the standard input to <file>.
: xwrite <file> <data> ...
        Writes each argument after <file> to the latter.
:

Additionally, wmiir provides the following utility commands relevant
to scripting wmii:

: namespace
	Prints the current wmii namespace directory, usually
	equivalent to /tmp/ns.$USER.${DISPLAY%.0}, but possibly
	different depending on the value of $NAMESPACE and
	$WMII_NAMESPACE.

	Synonyms: `ns`
: setsid [-0 <argv0>] [-f] <command>
	Executes the given command after setting the session id (see
	setsid(2)). If _-0_ is given, the command is run with the
	given value as argv[0]. For instance, to run sh as a login
	shell, one might run

```        wmiir setsid -0 -sh sh
	If _-f_ is given, wmiir will fork into the background before
	executing the command.
: proglist [--] <directory> ...
	Lists all executable commands in the given directories.

= ENVIRONMENT =

: $WMII_ADDRESS
        The address at which to connect to wmii.
: $NAMESPACE
        The namespace directory to use if no address is
        provided.
