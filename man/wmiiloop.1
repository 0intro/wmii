.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

eval
"$(wmiiloop
<events)"
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
wmiiloop
is an awk and sh script which preprocesses \fIsh\fP(1)
syntax 
to simplify writing a wmii event loop. 
.PP
wmiiloop
associates lines begining with \fIEvent\fP,
\fIAction\fP,
or 
\fIKey\fP
(henceforth known as \fB$keyword\fP),
followed by arbitrary 
text (henceforth known as \fB$args\fP),
with functions which call any 
indented lines which follow. In the function names, all non\-alphanumeric 
characters in \fB$args\fP
are replaced with underscores (_). The 
functions are named \fB$keyword\fP\&'_\&'\fB$args\fP\&.
.PP
Any variables in the unintented lines are interpolated by the shell. 
.PP
Additionally, each declaration\&'s \fB$args\fP
are assigned to a variable 
named \fB$keyword\fP\&'s\&'\&.
In this case, no transliteration occurs. For 
instance, the following declaration: 
.PP
.Vb
Key $MODKEY\-j
	echo Got $@
.Ve
yields (assuming \fI$MODKEY\fP
is set to \fIMod1\fP):
.PP
.Vb
Keys=" $Keys Mod1\-j"
Mod1_j() {
	echo Got $@
}
.Ve
