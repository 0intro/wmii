The following conditions apply to any distribution which
uses the name wmii.  These conditions apply only to wmii
name, and not to its source code or any other materials.

When in doubt about any of these conditions or other matters
of packaging or distribution, please contact the wmii
mailing lists <wmii-hackers@suckless.org> or
<wmii@suckless.org>, or Kris Maglione <fbsdaemon@gmail.com>.

Any binary distribution of wmii MUST have a properly set
version string. This string may normally be set in
'mk/wmii.mk', and is set automatically to the Mercurial
revision number for builds from a Mercurial tree, so long as
the 'hg' command is present and properly functioning.

Any version which is not an official release or snapshot
MUST be contain the hg revision number in its version
string.  This SHOULD be formatted as hgXXXX, where XXXX is
the decimal revision number.

The version string of any snapshot release MUST contain the
date of the snapshot in the form YYYYMMDD, and SHOULD
contain the word snap or snapshot.  The version string of a
snapshot MAY contain the version name of a full release that
the snapshot is expected to lead to, but it MUST be either
directly preceded, or directly followed by, the word 'pre',
optionally separated by a non-alphanumeric character,
including -~_,./.

Any binary distribution which is modified in any non-trivial
way MUST signify the modifications in its name or version
string.  This includes patches to use Xft for font display,
but does NOT include minor patches to improve consistency
with the rest of the system, including changing the default
terminal emulator or changing any build flags as set in
config.mk.

Source form distribution MAY include non-trivial patches
without such modifications, provided that the user is made
clearly aware of them at build time and/or prompted in some
way to enable or disable them.
