.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
.B wmir
is a client to access wmi* fileservers for the command line and
scripts. It can be used to configure wmii(1).
.SS Options
.TP
.BI \-s " socketfile"
lets you specify the socketfile to which
.B wmir
a connection will be established. If the environment variable
.B WMIR_SOCKET
is set and points to a socket file, wmir will use that file, if this
option is not supplied.
.TP
.B \-f
reads from stdin, useful for interactive wmir sessions or for
scripts that write/read a bunch of data, because this speeds things up
due to missing process creation/destruction, ie., a hack.
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to stderr, then exits.
.TP
The syntax of the actions is as follows:
.TP
.B create <path/file> [<value>]
creates file
.TP
.B write  <file> <value>
writes value to a file
.TP
.B read   <path/file>
reads file or directory contents
.TP
.B remove <path/file>
removes file or directory tree
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
WMIR_SOCKET
See above.
