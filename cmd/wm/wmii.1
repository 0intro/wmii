.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wmii
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Overview
.B wmii
is a script that launches the wmii window manager and its various utilities and
makes sure that they are configured for use.
.SS Actions
An action is a shell script in the default setup, but it can actually be
any executable file.  It is executed usually by selecting it from the
actions menu.
You can customize an action by copying it from the global action
directory CONFPREFIX/wmii-4 to $HOME/.wmii-4 and then editing the copy to
fit your needs.  Of course you can also create your own actions there; make
sure that they are executable.

.SS Configuration

bindings, the bar labels, etc.
