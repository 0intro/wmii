09:41 <@garbeam> gualteri: I think the mouse behavior should be the same as $MODKEY-Shift-{h,l} at the moment, 
                 with the same semantic, if one moves the last client of a column to another, the column gets 
                 destroyed
09:42 <@garbeam> if one moved the client outside the screen area more than 50% at left or right border, a new 
                 column is created, if the old column > 1 client
10:00 <@garbeam> /def/colwidth will be used for column creation of columns > 1, /def/colmode would define the mode 
                 of new columns
10:00 <@garbeam> though /def/colwidth will use promille or percentage values
