plan9port wmiirc
================

This directory contains a Plan 9 based wmiirc script.  This script was
traditionally the default wmiirc for wmii, but has been moved for
portability reasons.  To run this script, either Plan 9 from User
Space[1] (plan9port for short) or 9base[2] is required. Modifications
can be placed in $home/.wmii@CONFVERSION@/wmiirc_local.rc, which must
be executable.
