Python wmiirc
=============

This directory contains a pure Python implementation of
wmiirc. The two included libraries, pyxp and pygmi, are a 9P
client and wmii filesystem utility module, respectively. To
use this library, simply copy the contents of this direcctory
to @LOCALCONF@. To customize it, either modify wmiirc.py
directly, or create wmii_local.py and store your modifications
there. The latter approach is preferable in that future
modifications to wmiirc.py can usually be painlessly
integrated.

The documentation is sparse, but wmiirc.py should serve as a
fairly comprehensive example.
