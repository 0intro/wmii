This is a modified version of sunaku's wmiirc, designed for
his Rumai Ruby module. Minor configuration changes, namely to
the color scheme and default key bindings, as well as the
configuration search path, exist in this version. Builtin mpd
support has also been removed. Also added is support for
string interpolation in key bindings, as should be apparent in
the included config.yaml.

In particular, not that there is no need to copy any files to
~/.wmii-hg or ~/.wmii other than config.yaml. The script will
happily load the requisite files from their default install
location. They can be loaded either by involing wmii as
follows:

    wmiir -r ruby/wmiirc

or running the following after startup:

    wmiir xwrite /ctl spawn ruby/wmiirc

The rumai gem is still required, as noted below.

The original readme appears below unmodified:
