Alternative wmiirc scripts
==========================

This folder contains alternative implementations of wmii's rc
scripts. Each folder contains a different implementation,
described below, including its own README, wmiirc script, and
possibly other suppporting files and libraries. These scripts
are installed along with wmii to $(ETC) as defined in config.mk.

It usually suffices to start the included `wmiirc` script at
wmii startup. Invoking wmii with the flag '-r python/wmiirc',
for instance, will start the python implementation.
Alternatively, if you use a session manager, you can add this
line to @LOCALCONF@/wmiirc (which must be executable):

    wmiir xwrite /ctl spawn python/wmiirc
