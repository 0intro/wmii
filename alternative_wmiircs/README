Alternative wmiirc scripts
==========================

This folder contains alternative implementations of wmii's rc
scripts. Each folder contains a different implementation,
described below, including its own README, wmiirc script, and
possibly other suppporting files and libraries. It usually
suffices to copy the entire contents of the directory to
~/.wmii, but see the accompanying README file for more
details.
